## Compiling
Run `make` and three executables will be created:
* `sorting_benchmark.x` that performs a benchmark on the best and worst cases of insertion and quick sort.
* `linear_sorting_benchmark.x` that tests the sorting algorithms with linear complexity 
* `select_test.x` that tests the implementation of the select algorithm.
